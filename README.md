### Summary

The SIF3 Framework is a .NET framework that enables developers to efficiently
implement SIF3 Services (Consumers and/or Providers). It fully encapsulates the
low level SIF3 Infrastructure. It also provides a basic Environment Provider
which is core to SIF3.

The framework has some basic demo classes that illustrate how to use the
framework.

NOTE:

This current release is a Beta version that should only be used for inspection
