If you try to open Sif3Framework.sln (as instructed in the Demo documentation)in Visual Studio 2015 
(the project was create with VS 2013),you will get an error: 
“This project is incompatible with the current version of Visual Studio”.

To fix it, edit the file:

Sif3Framework-dotNet/Code/Sif3Framework/Sif.Framework/Sif.Framework.csproj

And change the ToolsVersion, ie,

was:
    <Project ToolsVersion="12.0" DefaultTargets="Build"
     xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
should be:
    <Project ToolsVersion="14.0" DefaultTargets="Build"
     xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    
After that, the project works correctly.
